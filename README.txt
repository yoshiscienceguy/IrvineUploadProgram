Hello Fellow Mentors,

This project was made so it can ease the creation and maintenance of folders in the Irvine Google Drive. The Program automatically uploads and downloads the correct code that the student was working with. 

_________________________________________________________________

Installation:

If you are downloading the program for windows, go to the Github or wherever Kumar decides to host the program, for right now I have it under my Github under user: yoshiscienceguy

The link - https://github.com/yoshiscienceguy/IrvineUploadProgram

Windows:

Download the zip so you can grab everything.
Extract the contents in the Document Folder, so Students won't touch it
Inside there is a folder called MxPiDrive, that is the main folder that contains the program. Open the Folder and inside there is a file called GUI.py That is the main program. Right click it and point it to "Send to" and send to the Desktop. This creates a shortcut of the program to the Desktop
Go to the Desktop and look for the shortcut. Right click the shortcut and go to it's properties. Click on Change Icon button and navigate through your Documents and find the Irvine Upload Program. Inside is an icon with the mathobotix logo. Click it and then click ok. 
Change the Shortcut's name. The current name of the project is called MxUpload. You have to ask if this is still the correct name.
Done! Run it to see if it works. - Pretty sure it does, tested 11/30/15 by Fernando

RaspberryPi/Unix:

Make sure you are online
Open Terminal
type "git clone **the link above** "
the program should be downloaded to your main home directory of the RPi. Ex- "\home\pi"
Go to the your home directory and find the downloaded items and look for the Setup file if it exists.
Go to the Console and type in sudo sh Setup
Everything is done for you. Congrats
Double click the shortcut on the Desktop to see if it works.
Hurray! Done!
